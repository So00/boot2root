We connect as Zaz : (cf first.md)

We use the method here from exploit-db, https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839
It creates a new user called firefart but we changed it so the user is root, you compile it
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt

you choose the password, you do
    su root
and type the password
AND VOILA
